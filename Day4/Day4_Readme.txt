Day 4:

User Feedback Form

This project is a simple yet effective user feedback form built using HTML and CSS. It enables users to share their feedback on recent updates, select their preferred features, and provide additional comments. The form is structured with fields for name, email, satisfaction level, and comments, along with a submit button for seamless data submission. Additionally, the project integrates a feature overview video and a system update sound to enhance user experience.


The feedback_form.html file defines the structure of the webpage using semantic HTML elements. The <header> contains the form title, while the <nav> section includes a simple navigation menu for quick access to different sections. The <section> elements organize content, such as the feedback form, video, and audio elements. The <form> includes input fields, dropdown menus, and a textarea for user feedback, along with a submit button to send the data.

The styles.css file provides styling and layout enhancements. The project makes extensive use of Flexbox to create a well-structured and responsive design, ensuring elements are aligned properly. The navigation menu uses CSS styling for a clean and modern look, with hover effects for better user interaction. Media queries adjust the layout dynamically for different screen sizes, ensuring mobile compatibility. Buttons, form fields, and sections are styled with appropriate colors, spacing, and borders to create a visually appealing user interface.


To use this form, simply clone or download the repository and open feedback_form.html in a modern web browser. The st.css file can be modified to customize the appearance, and placeholder media files should be replaced with actual content
