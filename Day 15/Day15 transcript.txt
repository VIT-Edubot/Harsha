Assignment: Introduction to Tailwind CSS
Scenario: You’ve been hired as a junior front-end developer at LaunchDarkly, where your first task is to create a simple but responsive web page layout. The company uses Tailwind CSS for styling, and you need to demonstrate your ability to work with utility-first CSS classes to style components. The goal of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with Tailwind CSS by installing it in a React project and using utility classes to style various elements, including layout, text, and buttons.
________________________________________
Assignment Tasks:
1. Set Up a New React Project with Tailwind CSS:
•	Set up a new Vite React project (if you haven’t already) and install Tailwind CSS by following these steps:
o	Create a new Vite React project:
npm create vite@latest react-tailwind-demo --template react
cd react-tailwind-demo
npm install
npm run dev
o	Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies:
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init
o	Add Tailwind’s directives to your src/index.css or src/styles/tailwind.css file:
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
o	Add the following to tailwind.config.js:
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./index.html",
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
2. Build a Simple Layout with Tailwind CSS:
•	Create a responsive webpage layout with the following sections:
1.	Header with a logo (a simple text element) and a navigation bar with links.
2.	Main Content section with a title and a paragraph of text.
3.	Footer with some basic text, like copyright information.
•	Use Tailwind’s utility classes to style these components and ensure that the layout is responsive. Focus on the following:
o	Header:
	Use flexbox (flex, justify-between, items-center) for positioning.
	Add spacing and alignment utilities like p-4 for padding and bg-gray-800 for background color.
o	Main Content:
	Use typography utilities for the title and paragraph (e.g., text-4xl, font-bold, text-gray-700).
	Add padding and margins with classes like p-6 and mt-8.
o	Footer:
	Position the footer at the bottom of the page using fixed or absolute positioning.
	Use text utilities like text-center and text-sm.
3. Style Components with Tailwind CSS:
•	Buttons:
o	Create a simple button in the main content and style it using Tailwind's utility classes.
o	Use background color (bg-blue-500), text color (text-white), padding (py-2 px-4), and border radius (rounded-md).
o	On hover, change the background color using hover:bg-blue-600.
4. Ensure Responsiveness with Tailwind's Utility Classes:
•	Use responsive design features to make your layout work on different screen sizes:
o	Use sm:, md:, lg:, and xl: breakpoints to apply styles conditionally based on screen width.
o	For example, on smaller screens, the navigation links in the header should stack vertically, while on larger screens, they should be displayed horizontally.
•	In this example, on small screens, the navigation items will stack vertically, and on larger screens, they will be aligned horizontally.
5. Submission:
•	Submit the following files:
1.	src/App.jsx: Your main React component with the Tailwind-styled layout.
2.	src/index.css: The Tailwind CSS setup.
3.	README.md: A brief explanation of how you installed and used Tailwind CSS, and how you styled the page.
