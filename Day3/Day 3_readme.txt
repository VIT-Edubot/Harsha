# User Feedback Form  with styling

This project is a User Feedback Form built using HTML and CSS. It includes a feedback submission form, a navigation menu, and multimedia elements such as video and audio. The form allows users to provide their names, email addresses, satisfaction levels, preferred features, and additional comments.  

The project consists of CSS implementations: an external CSS file (styles.css).The external CSS file provides a styling approach.  To run the project, simply open the `feedback_form.html` file in a web browser. I prefered using the external CSS file and ensured that the following line is included in the `<head>` section of the HTML:  

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

The CSS file (`styles.css`) makes the webpage look clean and user-friendly. It sets a default font and background color for consistency. The header has a gray background with bold white text. The navigation menu has a dark blue background with gold-colored links. The feedback form has a white background, rounded input fields, and a shadow effect for a modern look. Buttons are green and change color when hovered over. Videos and audio are centered, and the footer has a dark background with light text.
  
The feedback form is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. However, the form does not currently submit data to a server, as it is only a front-end implementation. Additionally, the provided video and audio sources are placeholders and should be replaced with actual media files if needed.
