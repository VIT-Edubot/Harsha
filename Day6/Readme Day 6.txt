Readme Day 6:

This  is a User Feedback Form designed for the LaunchDarkly Employee Portal using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form provides an interactive way for users to submit feedback while ensuring a smooth experience with real-time validation and a dynamic rating system. Users can enter their name, email, satisfaction level, and rate specific features, after which the form processes and validates the inputs before submission.

The JavaScript functionality is at the core of this project. It includes multiple functions that handle key operations. The validateFields() function ensures all required fields are filled before submission, preventing empty form submissions. The submitFeedback(event) function manages the form submission process by validating user inputs, ensuring the correct format for emails, verifying selected satisfaction levels, and calculating an average rating based on feature scores. Additionally, handleRatingChange() listens for rating selections and dynamically updates the interface to display a thank-you message. Finally, resetForm() allows users to reset the form and clear all fields.

This project also makes use of JavaScript events to improve user interaction. The feedback form listens for the submit event to prevent default submission and validate input fields before proceeding. The rating selection triggers change events, ensuring users receive immediate feedback on their selection. Additionally, the reset button is linked to a click event, allowing users to clear the form with a single click.

To efficiently manage input validation and dynamic changes, the project employs loops. The validateFields() function iterates through all form fields using a for loop to check for empty values. Similarly, handleRatingChange() iterates through rating input elements, adding event listeners to each. The submitFeedback(event) function also uses a for-of loop to validate feature ratings, ensuring that users provide values within the correct range of 1 to 5.

This project consists of three main files: feedback_form.html for the form structure, styles.css for styling, and feedback.js for implementing JavaScript functionality. To use the feedback form, open feedback_form.html in a web browser, fill in the required fields, select a rating, and submit the form. If any field is incomplete, an error message will notify the user before submission. The form also calculates an average rating based on user inputs, ensuring meaningful feedback collection.
