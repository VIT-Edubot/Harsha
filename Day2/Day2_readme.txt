Day 2:

I created this HTML-based feedback form to collect user input on recent updates and preferred features. It includes a form, a video section, and an audio section.I structured the document using semantic elements for better readability. The header displays the title, followed by a navigation menu. The form collects name, email, satisfaction level, and additional comments. Multimedia sections provide a video overview and an audio update, with a footer displaying copyright information.

One challenge I faced was ensuring form validation, which I solved by adding the required attribute. I also focused on maintaining a clean structure using <header>, <nav>, <section>, and <footer>.
The main file is feedback_form.html. Users can open it in a browser, fill out the form, watch the video, and listen to the audio.
