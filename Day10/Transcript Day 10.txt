Transcript Day 10:

Assignment: Props and Component Composition at LaunchDarkly Scenario: As a front-end developer at LaunchDarkly, you are tasked with enhancing the employee dashboard application. This time, you will focus on passing data through props and composing components. The goal is to create a more modular and flexible application by breaking down the employee list into smaller, reusable components that can be composed together. You will need to: • Pass employee data to child components using props. • Compose different components to build the employee dashboard. ________________________________________ Assignment Tasks: 1. Set Up Your React Project: o If you don't already have your React project set up, create a new React project using Vite: npm create vite@latest react-employee-dashboard --template react cd react-employee-dashboard npm install npm run dev 2. Create the Employee Card Component: o Create a new component called EmployeeCard. This component will be responsible for displaying an individual employee's details (name, position, and department). o Use props to pass the employee data to this component. o Each EmployeeCard should display the employee's:  Name  Position  Department o The EmployeeCard component should be reusable, meaning you should be able to display multiple employees by passing different data to each component. 3. Create the Employee Dashboard Component: o Create the EmployeeDashboard component, which will manage the list of employees and pass the data to EmployeeCard as props. o Inside the EmployeeDashboard component, define an array of employee objects. Each object should include:  Name  Position  Department o Use map() to loop through the array of employees and render an EmployeeCard for each employee. 4. Styling the Components: o Apply basic styling to the EmployeeCard and EmployeeDashboard components.  Ensure that each employee card has a border and padding for visual separation.  The employee dashboard should have a centered layout with some spacing between the cards. 5. Add an Additional Component for Header: o Create a Header component that will display the title "Employee Management System" at the top of the dashboard. o The Header component should not receive any props as it will be static, but it should be rendered inside EmployeeDashboard. 6. Enhance the Dashboard with Dynamic Data: o While this exercise uses hardcoded employee data, you could eventually replace this with data fetched from an API or external data source. For this assignment, keep it simple by focusing on passing props to child components. ________________________________________ Submission: Submit the following files: 1. src/App.jsx: The main file where you initialize and render the EmployeeDashboard component. 2. src/EmployeeDashboard.jsx: The component that holds the employee list and renders EmployeeCard components. 3. src/EmployeeCard.jsx: The reusable component that displays individual employee information. 4. src/Header.jsx: The component that contains the header title. 5. README.md: A brief explanation of your approach: o How did you pass props to child components? o Describe how component composition helps in building modular applications. o Any challenges faced in creating reusable components. ________________________________________ Learning Outcomes: By completing this assignment, you will: • Learn how to pass data between React components using props. • Understand component composition and how to break down a UI into smaller, reusable components. • Gain experience with modular design, a key concept in building scalable React applications. This task will set a solid foundation for working with props and component composition, which are essential for building maintainable React applications at LaunchDarkly and beyond.

Optimized Approach for the Employee Dashboard Application
1. Set Up Your React Project:
Use Vite to set up a React project which is known for its fast build times, suitable for competitive environments.
Follow these steps:
Execute command: npm create vite@latest react-employee-dashboard --template react.
Navigate to project directory: cd react-employee-dashboard.
Install dependencies: npm install.
Start development server: npm run dev.
2. Create the Employee Card Component:
Objective: Reusable component to display individual employee details.
Design considerations:
Use props to pass the employee data.
Each EmployeeCard should accept:
Name
Position
Department
Structurally:
Create a functional component.
Use destructuring to extract props.
Ensure reusability (should work irrespective of number and order of instances).
3. Create the Employee Dashboard Component:
Purpose: Manage the collection of employees and render EmployeeCard components.
Steps:
Initiate an array of employee objects within EmployeeDashboard. Each object should have name, position, and department.
Use map() to iterate over this array and render an EmployeeCard for each employee.
Design considerations:
Ensure the employee list can be dynamically extended or modified, which can be maintained when connected to an external data source.
Implement error handling to filter and manage invalid data entries in the employee list.
4. Styling the Components:
Basic style implementation:
For EmployeeCard, include border and padding to visually separate each card.
Center layout of EmployeeDashboard with proper spacing between employee cards.
Specific CSS components:
Maintain clean and scalable CSS architecture, using modular CSS or CSS-in-JS approach if preferred.
Use flexbox or grid for layout management.
5. Add an Additional Component for Header:
Objective: Display static header for the dashboard.
Design considerations:
Create a Header component with the title "Employee Management System".
Render this component inside EmployeeDashboard but without relying on props as it's static content.
6. Enhance the Dashboard with Dynamic Data:
Future-proofing:
For now, hardcode employee data for simplicity.
Plan for integration with APIs or external data sources to fetch employee data dynamically.
Using useEffect and axios or fetch for API calls would be the next step when moving towards dynamic data handling.
Submission Files:
src/App.jsx:

Initialization and rendering of EmployeeDashboard within the main application.
src/EmployeeDashboard.jsx:

Managing employee list.
Rendering EmployeeCard components using props.
src/EmployeeCard.jsx:

Reusable component, accepts and displays individual employee details.
src/Header.jsx:

Static header component showing the title "Employee Management System".
README.md:

Explanation on props usage to pass data.
Description of component composition benefits.
Challenges encountered in creating reusable components.
Learning Outcomes Achieved:
Passing data using props effectively between React components.
Understanding of breaking down UI into smaller, reusable components for modular design.
Experience with scalable React applications using component composition.
By following these steps, you can ensure an optimized approach to structuring, styling, and managing a modular front-end application in React, setting a foundation for more complex and dynamic implementations in the future.
