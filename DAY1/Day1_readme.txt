Created a webpage for LaunchDarkly using HTML.
Here we structured the webpage using different HTML elements and implemented a simple webpage layout. 
We also learned about metadata in the <head> section, setting the viewport for responsiveness, and adding links and images with 
appropriate attributes.
We also learned to use  <h1> heading tags </h1>, <p> paragraph tags</p>, <ul><li>list tags</li><ul>, and image tag (<img src=" ">).
